## Writing notes in Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. ReadMeEditor supports a Markdown Syntax.

In general, while Markdown is a markup language, it is meant to be human readable, even without being rendered. This is a simple example (you can see how it looks in the viewer panel):

---

# Heading

## Sub-heading

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line. Text attributes _italic_, **bold** and `monospace` are supported. You can create bullet lists:

- apples
- oranges
- pears

Or numbered lists:

1. wash
2. rinse
3. repeat

Or code blocks:

```typescript
const count: number = 0;
console.log('Hello World');
```
